About Portage
=============

Portage is a package management system based on ports collections. The
Package Manager Specification Project (PMS) standardises and documents
the behaviour of Portage so that ebuild repositories can be used by
other package managers.


Dependencies
============

Python and Bash should be the only hard dependencies. Python 2.7 is the
minimum supported version.

Native Extensions
=================

Portage includes some optional native extensions which can be built
in the source tree by running the following command:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace --portage-ext-modules

The following setup.cfg settings can be used to enable building of
native extensions for all invocations of the build_ext command (the
build_ext command is invoked automatically by other build commands):

   [build_ext]
   portage-ext-modules=true

Currently, the native extensions only include libc bindings which are
used to validate LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE behavior for EAPI 6. If the
native extensions have not been built, then portage will use ctypes
instead.
